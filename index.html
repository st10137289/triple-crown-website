        <h1>Triple Crown Trophy</h1>
        <p> The Triple Crown is the ultimate achievement in school rowing, earned only by winning Boatrace, Buffalo, and SA Champs in the same season. It’s not just about talent or a single standout performance. It demands consistency, composure, and the ability to rise to the moment, again and again.

            Once Boatrace is over, only one school remains in contention. From there, every race becomes a test of whether that crew can carry the weight of expectation all the way to the end. If they fall at Buffalo or SA Champs, then the pursuit ends — and no Triple Crown is awarded that year. The trophy isn’t won, it’s earned. And some years, it simply isn’t earned.

            There’s also a quiet truth in the Triple Crown: the journey isn’t one-sided. Every other crew in the field plays a part. To stop a Triple Crown run, to be the crew that stands firm when the stakes are highest, is an achievement in its own right. It won’t be written on the trophy or listed in records, but it’s understood: everyone shapes the story.
            But in the end, we reward excellence — and excellence means finishing the season on top.

            The Triple Crown applies to both the Boys First Eight and the Girls First Quad, honoring crews who not only start strong, but end stronger — who hold their form under pressure, hold their identity under challenge, and leave no doubt.</p>
