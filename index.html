        <h1>Triple Crown Trophy</h1>
        <!--
       <p>
           The Triple Crown is the highest honour in South African school rowing, awarded only to a crew that wins
           Boatrace, Buffalo, and SA Champs in the same season. It is not defined by a single standout moment, but by
           consistency, composure, and the ability to perform under pressure, again and again.
       </p>

       <p>
           After Boatrace, only one school remains in contention. From that point on, every race becomes a test of whether
           the crew can carry the weight of expectation. If they fall at Buffalo or SA Champs, the pursuit ends. The Triple
           Crown is never simply handed out — some seasons, it is not earned at all.
       </p>

       <p>
           Yet the story is shaped by every crew in the field. To stop a Triple Crown run — to stand firm when the stakes
           are highest — is an achievement in its own right. It may not appear on any trophy, but its impact is understood
           by everyone who rows.
       </p>

       <p>
           Ultimately, the Triple Crown celebrates excellence. It applies to both the Boys First Eight and the Girls First
           Quad, honouring crews who start strong, finish stronger, and hold their identity under challenge from the first
           stroke to the last.
       </p>
